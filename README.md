NumberGuess is a number logic game
with 5 different levels 
you can choose from.
##
It is not possible to cheat since the code is told to generate random.
   No AI bots or extensions were used in this code.
     Like I said before, the code is told to generate a random word.
        this is without the use of any AI word generators or anything related whatsoever.
           Code example: import random
